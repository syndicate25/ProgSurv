* Added new "Animal Fat" texture. This replaces Tallow as a drop from animals.
* Added new, more realistic recipe for Bottled Tallow.
* Added new (and more generous) torch recipe, using Bottled Tallow.
* New recipe added for Bottled Tallow.

 

Mods

Added:

+ NoSecrets - Removes Super Secret Settings from the Menu options.
+ VineClimber - Allows you to climb vines even if there's no supporting block behind them. SMP issue was fixed, so this mod was added back to the modpack. Please report any crashes associated with this mod (if any) so I can report them back to the mod author.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.22

Changes:

* Lock in Dragon Dungeon is now unbreakable.. again.
* Zombies/Skeletons now spawn when it's dark enough for them to not burn, and should not spawn in the daytime anymore.
* Removed Garden Biome - Nothing would spawn there anyway, can't figure out why, so that's why it was removed.
* Adjusted Dire Wolf spawn rate.

 

Mods

Added:

+ BNBGamingLib - For my personal server and friends using CF to download the pack. Mod is required for Server using "Suspended Server" mod.
+ Hopper Ducts - More options for automation with hoppers.
+ Misc Tweaks - Sets appropriate difficulty (hard) automatically, plus a few other "things"
* Updated Xaero's Minimap & Worldmap mods.

Removed:

- Hydrophobic Skeletons - Didn't realize all that did was make Skeletons die in the water, which is not the intended behavior.
- R2R Utils - No longer see the need/relevance of forcing players to wear armor to dig, and it's causing problems when not underground still because it still thinks you're underground when you're not.... So, bye bye.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.21

+ Updated Serene Seasons to 1.2.19 - This version is Server compatible.  Server pack is being added soon!


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.20 BETA

Fixes:
* Reverted change - Zombies "see through" walls again which just means they can sense where you are, regardless of what you're hiding behind. Originally "seeing through walls" was removed to alleviate Zombies punching you through the wall, which helped because they weren't constantly up against your walls. However, this has unintentionally changed the difficulty at night twofold - Zombies are no longer a threat to your doors, gates, etc., and night time is a lot tamer than it was intended to be. For these reasons, the change was reverted.
* Zombies no longer eat things off the ground. This was a problem for people who would build against the wall because Zombies would eat whatever dropped out of those machines/blocks (Tanning Rack, for example) before you had a chance to pick the items up yourself, since they could "see through" walls. So fear not, your items are safe from consumption. You, however, are not.
* Made locking chests and doors ACTUALLY invincible, as they were intended to be. This was an oversight in the last release (what's new..).
* Removed "Faded" - An alternate "smarter" Zombie that spawns with weapons and tools. Zombies don't need to be smart. They overwhelm you with sheer numbers.
* Further adjusted animal spawn rates to hopefully get them showing up in larger groups of their respective types. This means it's easier to find resources, but also more dangerous, since animals will help their own kind when attacked.
* Removed some old unused config files to prevent downloading a negligible amount of unnecessary content


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.19 BETA

Fixes:
+ Updated even more quest text to be more accurate and in line with the latest updates.
+ More tooltips added to various items to help with their usage.
+ Adjusted spawn rates of all Vanilla MC animals and monsters since animals were somewhat sparse, and monsters needed a slight tweak.
+ Updated Crafttweaker scripts to handle new WildMobs item names after updating
+ Disabled EntityTickOptimization in ArchaicFix - Causing low spawn rates and weird minimap behavior (flickering).

 

Mods:
+ Locks - Custom Dungeons now spawn with some chests/doors locked that require a lockpick to open, and are unbreakable (same as bedrock). Lockpicks have been given a fairly easy recipe, but also break easily. This mod isn't customizable for 1.7.10.
+ Hydrophobic Skeletons - Skeletons can no longer hide in water making them a little easier to handle.
+ Clock HUD - A different way to keep track of day/night. Toggle on/off with default key (COMMA).
+ Born in a Barn - Fixes a bug where Village doors keep chunks loaded.
+ Carveable Pumpkins - A little late for Halloween, but who doesn't like carving their own pumpkin?
+ Updated WildMobs to the latest version - Removes a few unused mobs, adds a few new mobs/creatures.
+ Nef's Deco Mod - Adds a few nice decorative items.

 

Other Changes:
* Added new quest for lockpicks to "Treasure Hunter" quest line.
* Added Travelling Merchant - Sell some of your stuff to make a little extra money. They buy a variety of items, from Zombie Flesh, to crafted foods. Beware - Travelling Merchants naturally despawn, so pack a bag before trying to find one of these guys.
* Added Bone Pickaxe recipe to Carpenter's Table for an alternate pickaxe option. Recipe is not in NEI.
* Added Lockpick recipe to Anvil. Recipe is not in NEI.
* Added a tab to the in-game Wiki for recipes I've added that are not in, and cannot be added to NEI. (Currently just two recipes)
* Other minor tweaks to the in-game Wiki content.
* Francine in the NPC Trade Market now buys the meat you get from your butchered animals.
* Extended Seasons from 7 MC days to 15 MC days.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.18 BETA

Fixes:
- Zombies and Skeletons can no longer track you through doors/walls. This will help with getting punched through walls since they won't all be up against your house all the time unless they can see you. Unfortunately I believe this is just a bug with 1.7.10 that I don't know how to get around. :(
- Updated a few beginning quests to be more direct in their explanations.
- Removed some old invalid information in some quests.
- Removed some duplicate quests.
- Moved and added some crafting/item quests to make more sense where they fall in the quest line.
- Cobwebs should now drop between 1-2 string when broken with a sword.
- Cauldrons from BetterVanilla should now be exchangeable for Vanilla Cauldrons (so you can salvage them at the salvaging station)
- Mob heads on the minimap are now disabled by default. I recommend leaving that off otherwise some mob skins get messed up. Not sure why...

Changes:
- Slightly reduced the amount of item durability lost on death from 32 to 20.
- Added tooltip to Jug to indicate it can be filled at a water source or trough.
- Reduced twine to string recipe cost from 4 vines to 2 vines.
- Increased Fresh Baked Bread recipe output from 2 to 3.
- Crops that are planted when not in season will no longer break. They will however still not grow until they are in season again.
- Updated Launch GUI to show world types for SMP and SSP.
- Added a few new "bonus" armor crafting quests to the initial quest line.
- Removed "Food Journal" as a starting item.
- Added new "Coins!" quest line.
- Added Tooltip to Coins to help make it more obvious what they're used for.
- Removed "Wall Breaker" mob as it is unused now

Mods:
- Reverted Not Enough Items to version 2.1.1.2 since anything newer requires a ChickenCore version unobtainable through the Curseforge launcher.
- Updated Cuchaz Ships mod - Now with less bloat! Yay! (Thanks jer0me226)
- Added Modern KeyBinding - Features:
* You can now define a keybinding's activation key with key modifiers. Like "Ctrl + G" or "Alt + S";
* The keybindings with the same activation key but different key conflict contexts will not conflict now.
* "Non-conflict keys" (disabled by default): The keybindings with the same key will all be activated if the key is pressed.
- Added Keyboard Wizard: Legacy
- The mod helps with solving key conflicts and finding unbound keys. It adds an "extra" controls GUI that displays an interactive keyboard in the center.
- Updated a few mods to their latest versions.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.17

Fixes:

- Updated a few beginning quests to be more direct in their explanations.
- Removed some old invalid information in some quests.
- Removed some duplicate quests.
- Moved and added some crafting/item quests to make more sense where they fall in the quest line.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.16 HF-1

HOTFIX:
* Reverted Tornado logic - Tornadoes were far too destructive with the last update. My apologies to those who lost their homes...

3.0.16

Bugfixes:
* Wizards' spells no longer crash the game when cast on players/other entities.
* Hopefully fixed Rebind once and for all..
* Candied Bacon recipe no longer requires "fire" to craft
 
Changes:
* Reduced time for biome text to disappear.
* Corrected Oak Fence recipe (now gives 4x Oak Fences instead of 1x).
* Added Tallow item - Animals, namely Cows, Bison, and Sheep, now drop Tallow occassionally. Used for Torches, and Cooking Oil.
* Adjusted some music track values, and removed some invalid entries with missing tracks.
* Fixed a lot of random non-critical/non-crashing errors in the loading log (added missing sounds, textures, fixed lang files, etc.)

Mods:
+ AromaBackup/AromaCore - Because everyone loves backups of their world.  Should probably have had this in the first place.. 
+ CleanView - I believe the crash here has been resolved and was likely the same issue that was causing the TickingEntity crash with Wizards' spells. 
*Enable/disable to your liking.
+ CompatibilityLayerForCustomSkinLoader - Fixes skins not rendering properly on the player in some cases, and fixes rendering of TWF Giants/Giant Miners.
+ Durability Show - Now you can see your held item's durability in a conveniently located information widget just above your hunger bar.
- Flying Cullers (DISABLED) - Makes entities stop rendering at certain distances. With the addition of other fixes and improvements, this doesn't seem necessary anymore. 
*Enable/disable to your liking.
Notes:
* Knowledge Talismans are disabled in Progressive Survival. The module has been renamed to indicate this in the Research Book. Clicking on the "MODULE DISABLED" will result in a game crash.
* Working on getting a fix for Cuchaz Ships which causes a ton of console/log spam due to issues with CoreModTransformer.java.


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.15

More fixes! Yay! My apologies for some basic oversights in the last two releases which have prevented players from making new worlds. 

Added:
+ Elytra Bombing - Light and drop TNT from your Elytra!
+ New crafting recipe for Bottle o' Enchanting.
+ New rare-ish drop from mobs - XP Fragment, used for crafting Bottle o' Enchanting. XP is important!
 
Removed:
- Mine&Battlegear2 - Should have been removed a long time ago...yet, still wasn't and was causing conflicts/crashes.
- CleanView - Causing repeating crash with Lootable Bodies.
- VineClimber - Crashing servers with TickingEntity, disallowing players to reconnect until they're moved or the offending vine(s) are destroyed.
* MouseTweaks - DISABLED IN CF LAUNCHER. 
Reason: Left MB Tweak conflict was causing involuntary auto attacks. You can enable the mod if you prefer the functionality over the bug, but no support will be offered if you are using this mod for this issue. This will also cause the involuntary attack bug to return.

Changes/Bugfixes:
* Disabled BOP block generation/use for Taverns mod due to SMP conflicts.
* Corrected Zombie detection range and spawn rate.
* Corrected Skeleton spawn rate.
* Adjusted ArchaicFix config options that were preventing monster spawns.
* Reduced amount of levels required to unlock inventory slots with InfiniteInvo.
* Adjusted block requirement over your head to only apply while actually under a certain Y level, instead of when you're under X amount of blocks, regardless of Y position. This should remedy the issue with needing a helmet when inside your home (above ground), trying to chop down a tall tree, etc.
* Adjusted blocks that Skeletons and Zombies can break and fiddle with.
* Fixed Rebind configs once again


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.14

* Resolved Rebind mod crash
* Added mods that never got added (oops)
* Removed Simple Storage (was not supposed to be added after testing)
* Updated version in ITLT

...This should be all for now! :D


*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************


3.0.13

***HUGE UPDATE!***

***NEW WORLDS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!***

EXISTING WORLDS WILL PROBABLY NOT PLAY WELL WITH THIS UPDATE! 
BACK UP YOUR WORLD BEFORE PLAYING WITH THIS UPDATE!


MAJOR Changes:

	+ LIMITED INVENTORY SPACE
		+ Inventory slots start locked (except your hotbar) and must now be unlocked using XP. This has always been the intention, but now it's a reality! :D
		+ Slots are unlocked by spending xp. Slots are not lost upon death.	

	+ SKILLS! (GokiSkills Mod - Default Key: Home) You can now spend XP to gain benefits of your choice!  Including, but not limited to:
			* Proficiency in Mining, Digging, and Trimming (Shears)
			* Jump farther and higher
			* Do more damage with certain types of weapons
			* .. and more!
	
	+ SHIPS MOD REPLACING ARCHIMEDES SHIPS
		+ SMP experienced several desync issues using Archimedes ships and as such as been replaced by the Ships mod, by Cuchaz. This will cause any ships you've built already to stop functioning until you integrate them with the new mod. Ships also has a much more unique way of building/using ships that was more interesting.
				


MINOR Changes:

NPCs:
	+ Banker - Sometimes spawns in villages. Allows you to exchange your coins for emeralds to trade with the villagers.
	+ Corrected/shortened Scarecrow dialogue/quest details.
	+ Corrected "Your Conscience" dialogue.
	* Renamed a certain Market NPC to "Mikey" as his former name was not family friendly.


OTHER: 
	+ New Allies - Archers, Knights, and Mages! See more in the section below.
	+ New Enemy - Bloodthirsty Zombie. (Should) Spawn somewhat rarely, and only during a full moon; like the Plague Spreader. These are no ordinary zombie, deal extra damage, and can outrun the average player.
	+ Zombie appetites are now insatiable! They will eat almost everything in sight, including your livestock, and even food on the ground.
	+ Twilight Forest catalyst item change.
		* Item used to create the Twilight Forest portal has changed from a Diamond to the Twilight Forest Portal Catalyst - Crafting recipe available via NEI.
	+ Updated textures for some existing mods from their later versions (e.g Nether Ores, Mowzie's Mobs), and added a few custom textures.
	+ Made most the custom dungeons spawn with unbreakable blocks.
	+ Custom music for each Biome type, and some events, like Boss fights, mob battles, rain/storms, going underground, night time, etc.
	+ Stamina system has been reintroduced. Don't run out in combat or you might find yourself in a predicament!



ADDED:
	+ ArchaicFix - Fixes a plethora of issues in 1.7.10 code and greatly boosts game performance. Woohoo!
	+ CallowCraft - Groups XP drops together.  Reduces lag/memory use, and easier to collect XP drops.
	+ Castle Defenders - Adds Archers, Knights, and Mages that will fight for you. The higher the level, the more accurage they are and the more damage they deal. These however, are uncraftable, and must be purchased from The Collector NPC by finding his hut. There might be a few variations of this NPC, so you'll have to hunt down the right one!
	+ Cleanview - Removes potion particles from the player perspective.
	+ Controlling - Enables searchable keybindings.
	+ Darwin Water Ambience - Adds new awesome water effects.
	+ Disenchant Table - Remove enchantments from items. 25% chance that an enchantment will be lost upon disenchanting an item.
	+ Doors - Adds a couple new door styles.
	+ GokiSkills - Spend XP to improve your stats.
	+ Hardcore Ender Expansion - Because the Ender Dragon fight is supposed to be "end game" material, and it was definitely not.
	+ Hearts - Mobs now have a chance to drop hearts on death. Walking over a heart will automatically consume it and heal 1 heart of damage.
	+ Hungry Zombies - Zombies now try to eat everything, including your livestock, as I imagine "real" zombies would do.  As mentioned above, their appetites are insatiable.
	+ InfiniteInvo - Inventory slots start locked, and can be unlocked with XP.
	+ ItemSearch - Search nearby chests with a simple command. Matching items show up in red text. Command syntax: "/search <name|clear> [radius]"
	+ KoRIN Regions - Adds a nice popup announcing the Biome change.
	+ Music Choices - Custom music for minecraft events (night time, boss fights, biome changes, etc.) 
	+ Name Pain - Makes it easier to see when your friends/allies are in trouble.
	+ Not Enough Pets - Adds the parrot as a new pet type, and overhauls existing pets' behavior (Cats/Dogs).
	+ Placeable Gunpowder - No more redstone required to light TNT. Leave a trail of gunpowder instead!
	+ Placeable Tools - No where to put your tool? Taking up too much space on your hotbar? Stick your axe in a tree instead!
	+ Real Bench - Crafting Tables hold their inventory, and other players can see your crafting process. Items drop when table is broken.
	+ Realistic Brewing Stand - If you put a potion in brewing stand, it will now be visible on the stand.
	+ Serene Seasons - Seasons will now change, which can affect crop growth.
	+ Ships - Replaced Archimedes Ships. More immersive, and (hopefully) works better than Archimedes in 1.7.10 (Hoping for less desync!)
	+ Sleep - After sleeping through the night, receive a regeneration buff for 10 seconds. Now sleep REALLY rejuvinates you!
	+ Sound Filters - Adds reverb to caves, and mutes sounds when you're underwater and when the sound source is behind a wall.
	+ Special AI - Monsters (Skeletons and Zombies) now push buttons, break light sources, and blocks like your bed, crafting tables, walls, fences, etc. Build to defend.
	+ Trashslot - Adds a Garbage slot to the inventory window.
	+ Twilight Forest Catalyst - Changes the item used to create the Twilight Forest portal.
	+ Waila Events/Waila Inhibitors - WAILA will not function in the dark (looking at a block will not display it's information like block type, harvestability, etc).  Try placing a light source if you can't see the information you'd expect.
	+ Several other QOL mods/improvements.
	+ Tidbits - Adds scaffolding to help build in Survival mode.
	+ Vine Climber - Allows you to climb vines that are hanging free with the jump key.
	+ Updated several existing mods to their latest versions.
	+ Loot tables in some dungeons/structures slightly changed/expanded.
	+ Made most custom built dungeons "cheat" proof.



REMOVED:
	- UpToDate - Redundant, and was not functioning properly anymore.
	- Mine&Battlegear2 - This mod also unfortunately causes hard mod comflicts with other mods that were deemed more important for progression play, and was removed. If you notice any significant changes/issues due to this change (besides not being able to dual wield/use shields) please report it in the issues section. 
	- Archimedes Ships - Had too many desync issues in SMP. Replaced by Cuchaz Ships mod.
	- Totem Defender - Replaced by Castle Defenders. 
	- Other duplicate/redundant blocks and items.
	- Invalid loot table items.
	- Cleaned up several unused/duplicate NPCs and organized the tabs they're stored in. (more of a behind the scenes cleanup)



Known Issues/Nuisances:
	* Battle music can play without direct line of sight to some entities. There currently is no workaround for this.
	* (CREATIVE MODE ONLY) Scrolling your player inventory while in another inventory window (e.g. a chest) causes a crash.
	* Mob names show up multiple times, mainly with named mobs. I'm investigating if some of the redundancy can be removed.
	* If your inventory is full and you stand on an item on the ground, the item counter will increase rapidly, but this seems to be only cosmetic. No items have been duped in tests.



Other Notes:
	* Limited testing has been done with the Ships mod. If you notice any problems, please report them in the issues section!
	* Shields can still be used if you can find the rare drop from a Chocolate Quest dungeon (sword/shield combo)
